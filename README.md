The Odin Project 

Project: Recipes

This project will be an exercise purely for showcasing and improving HTML
skills. In the HTML foundations, HTML basics such as elements/tags,
boilerplates, text, lists, links, and images were taught. I expect that this
project will be a culmination of these. Additionally, we learned about how to
write good commit messages, such as keeping subject lines to 50 characters,
writing the commit in the imperative, and keeping the body wrapped at 72 chars.
I will do my best to adhere to such practices in this project.
