        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A classic breakfast dish beloved by all that is quick and easy to make!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp milk (optional, as needed)</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp shredded cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack eggs into a bowl. Season to taste with salt and black
            pepper, and add milk if desired to make the texture creamier. Beat
            eggs until fully combined.</li>
            <li>Put oil into a small non-stick pan/skillet. Put on medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Once the pan is hot, pour the egg mixture. Evenly distribute the
            mixture on the pan by swirling if necessary.</li>
            <li>Use a spatula to push cooked egg portions inward and tilt pan to
            allow the uncooked portions to make contact with the pan. Repeat
            until omelette becomes somewhat firm overall.</li>
            <li>Once the omelette is cooked on the bottom but still somewhat raw
            on top, sprinkle the shredded cheese on top of one half of the
            omelette.</li>
            <li>Use spatula to ease around the edges of the omelette. Take the
            omelette half with no cheese and fold over the cheese covered
            half.</li>
            <li>Once golden-brown, turn off heat and plate the omelette.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
