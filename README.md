Pre-Project Reflection:

This project will be an exercise purely for showcasing and improving HTML
skills. In the HTML foundations, HTML basics such as elements/tags,
boilerplates, text, lists, links, and images were taught. I expect that this
project will be a culmination of these. Additionally, we learned about how to
write good commit messages, such as keeping subject lines to 50 characters,
writing the commit in the imperative, and keeping the body wrapped at 72 chars.
I will do my best to adhere to such practices in this project.

Post-Project Reflection:

I think this project was a great way to apply the HTML foundational concepts. It
lets us practically use unordered and ordered lists, decide on heading
importance, and add an image to a webpage. I think the project was also helpful
to me in applying commit message practices we were shown. I feel that I did a
good job overall with them, but I believe I went over the 50 char limit for 2
commits without realizing it. In future projects I will be more careful in doing
so, but this is helpful as I had not been using subject + details as effectively
in previous projects. I did ensure to wrap text whenever needed. Overall, this
was a very enjoyable first project for The Odin Project, and I look forward to
more intermediate projects!
